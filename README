#Disaster Management Tool
##unfolding map api for map implementation and processing api for rendering graphics
==================================================================

This project aims to act as an analytical as well as a disaster management tool. The map shows earthquakes based on a legend, differentiating them on basis of location and severity. The earthquake data is pulled from usgs.gov.in's RSS feed for real time data.
The map defines the threat radius of any given earthquake, and highlights all the major cities and airports inside that radius.
It also features a database for reporting and searching for missing persons, and a webpage added to allow donations for supported causes.
